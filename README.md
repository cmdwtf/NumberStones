# 🔢💎 NumberStones

A .NET library that parses expressions to roll dice, and other such random things.

## 🥅 Project Goals

Provide a simple, easy to use interface for dice rolling and simple mathematic expression solving.

## 💡 Inspiration

NumberStones was born out of a desire to replace the late [Sidekick](https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick) Discord bot. There's a lot of functionality missing and a long way to go, but this library will serve as the RNG backend for [MathRox](https://github.com/cmdwtf/MathRox): the Discord front end for NumberStones.
